## How I Build ðŸ”§

- **Frontend Development:** We developed the frontend using React to create a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- **Smart Contracts:** Using Solidity, we crafted smart contracts to manage crowdfunding campaigns and transactions. These contracts were deployed on the Ethereum blockchain using Remix IDE.
- **Blockchain Interaction:** We utilized Ether.js to interact with the deployed smart contracts, ensuring smooth and secure communication between the frontend and blockchain.
- **Backend Development:** Node.js and Express.js were employed to create a robust backend, managing API requests and server-side logic.
- **Authentication:** Metamask was integrated for user authentication, allowing secure login and transaction signing.


## Challenges I Ran Into ðŸ’€

- **Blockchain Data Handling:** Handling data from the blockchain and integrating it seamlessly with the frontend required meticulous planning and execution.
- **User Experience:** Balancing the complexity of blockchain interactions with a user-friendly interface was a constant challenge.
